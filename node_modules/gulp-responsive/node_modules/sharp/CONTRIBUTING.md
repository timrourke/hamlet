# Contributing to sharp

Hello, thank you for your interest in helping!

## Submit a new bug report

Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/new) containing the steps to reproduce the problem.

New bugs are assigned a `triage` label whilst under investigation.

If you're having problems with `npm install sharp`, please include the output of the following commands, perhaps as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/):

```sh
vips -v
pkg-config --print-provides vips
npm install --verbose sharp
```

## Submit a new feature request

If a [similar request](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/labels/enhancement) exists, it's probably fastest to add a comment to it about your requirement.

Implementation is usually straightforward if _libvips_ [already supports](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/supported/current/doc/html/libvips/ch03.html) the feature you need.

## Submit a Pull Request to fix a bug

Thank you! To prevent the problem occurring again, please add unit tests that would have failed.

Please select the `master` branch as the destination for your Pull Request so your fix can be included in the next minor release.

Please squash your changes into a single commit using a command like `git rebase -i upstream/master`.

To test C++ changes, you can compile the module using `npm install` and then run the tests using `npm test`.

## Submit a Pull Request with a new feature

Please add JavaScript [unit tests](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/tree/master/test/unit) to cover your new feature.
